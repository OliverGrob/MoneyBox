Fixes:
- TODO: rename "init" methods in activity
- TODO: initialize spinners + recycle view only once, not always when changing the month
- TODO: jump to current year/month only at first start
    - when starting app and there was one previously selected, show that
    - when adding a new expense, don't change it to current again
+ if expense's amount is a whole number, don't show the .0
    - move the if which calculates it to a separate method/helper class
- TODO: further reduce complexity in init -> no need for observers everywhere


Updates:
- update category selecting/filtering multiple times in ExpenseActivityViewModel and/or try to simplify the business logic
- try to unify async task inner classes for one class for inserting entities
- app should save last state, on reopen should show the year/month it was before it was closed
- expense amount and total should be BigDecimal
- TODO: UI updates:
    - category should not appear after description -> new list item view?
    - total text for total amount spent
    - new separate activity for adding a new expense/category?
- TODO: refactor whole code


Features:
- TODO: add project to git
- categories
    + DB table (category-expense -> ony-to-many)
    + selectable for each expense, only 1 for each for a start
    + there should be default, but users should be able to add customs
    - TODO: default "no category" category
- TODO: edit expense
- TODO: delete expense
- TODO: delete category
- different currencies
    - sum in chosen currency
    - get exchange rate from somewhere
- more custom filtering
    - by expense amount
    - by category
    - by currency
    - by exact date
- we have the hour-min-sec as well, what should be do with that?
- a more detailed description on each expense item
    - ie. 5000 expense was from 3 items. onto clicking the item those 3 are visible
        5000 spar
          - 2500 chicken
          - 1500 rice
          - 1000 broccoli
    - able to upload photo of receipt maybe?
- TODO: statistics, summary, planning
    - in separate activity -> menu in the upper-left corner
    - users are able to create custom summary with default/custom categories in it
    - summary by category, currency etc.
    - users could add a target goal for each month, turns red on fail, green on success ie.
    - target could be like 60k, each expense is extracted from that
- advanced new expense addition
    + smart complete when typing the letters, mainly for duplicates
    - advanced display - highlight each letter that's typed in and matching
- TODO: SMS config - able to read expenses from given phone number's sms
- groping items on same day - ie. 2 expenses are on the same day, it adds them up, shows them in a drop-down
- dark mode
- tracking income as well
- setting custom intervals, not just months by default (ie. add expenses on every 20 day)
- unit tests:
    - performance
    - business logic
